# SafeUpgrade AI Agent

SafeUpgrade is an **AI-assisted DevOps agent** that safely upgrades JavaScript/Node.js dependencies by applying policy rules, dependency intelligence, and automated validation.

This repository contains **two implementations of the same agent**:

1. **CLI Agent** – runs locally or via Docker, designed for CI/CD and DevOps workflows  
2. **Vercel Agent** – a web-based UI + API deployed on Vercel for demos and interactive usage
